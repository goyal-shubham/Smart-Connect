# Smart-Connect

Objective:
To make a java application that randomly connects different people based on an algorithm designed to match 5 people based on various factors. 

These factors include:

Similar Interests 
Similar educational backgrounds
Similar Location
Based on Algorithmic calculated integraity levels.

The reasons to connect people with similar and different interests lie solely to introduce different people to different things. 

Our system will take in the details when a user makes an account. 
The account will be password protected and the password will be encrypted. 

The application will also give the people a platform to chat/communicate with each other and
they will have an option to block a person if they want to or friend/unfriend a person. This module will also use socket programming.
